ðŸ¤— Speechbox offers a set of speech processing tools, such as punctuation restoration.

# Installation

**With `pip`** (official package)
    
```bash
pip install speechbox
```

# Tasks

| Task | Description |
|-|-|
| [Punctuation Restoration](#punctuation-restoration) | Punctuation restoration allows one to predict capitalized words as well as punctuation by using [Whisper](https://huggingface.co/models?other=whisper). It relies on the simply premise that Whisper is good enough to transcribe any English ASR dataset. |

## Punctuation Restoration

```python
restorer = Restorer.from_pretrained(MODEL_ID)

```

See [examples/restore](https://github.com/huggingface/speechbox/blob/main/examples/restore.py) for more information.
