ü§ó Speechbox offers a set of speech processing tools, such as punctuation restoration.

# Installation

**With `pip`** (official package)
    
```bash
pip install speechbox
```

## Contributing

#We ‚ù§Ô∏è  contributions from the open-source community! 
#If you want to contribute to this library, please check out our [Contribution guide](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
#You can look out for [issues](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues) you'd like to tackle to contribute to the library.
#- See [Good first issues](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) for general opportunities to contribute
#- See [New model/pipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+pipeline%2Fmodel%22) to contribute exciting new diffusion models / diffusion pipelines

## Quickstart

#In order to get started, we recommend taking a look at two notebooks:
#
#- The [Getting started with Diffusers](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/diffusers_intro.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/diffusers_intro.ipynb) notebook, which showcases an end-to-end example of usage for diffusion models, schedulers and pipelines.
#  Take a look at this notebook to learn how to use the pipeline abstraction, which takes care of everything (model, scheduler, noise handling) for you, and also to understand each independent building block in the library.
#- The [Training a diffusers model](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/training_example.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/training_example.ipynb) notebook summarizes diffusion models training methods. This notebook takes a step-by-step approach to training your
#  diffusion models on an image dataset, with explanatory graphics.
